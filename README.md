## Code of Conduct

A Code of Conduct formally defines what is acceptable, unacceptable, and
encouraged behaviour. Whilst a Code of Conduct may not solve deeply rooted
issues, it is still important to put down in writing the community norms in a
clear and certain manner. Please remember that a Code of Conduct does not negate
the necessity to lead by example.
