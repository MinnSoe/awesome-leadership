# Awesome Leadership [![Awesome][badge]](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of awesome resources for setting up, running, and maintaining a
  community and its events.


This list was inspired by the [Mozilla Open Leadership][olts] programme by the
wonderful Abigail C. Mayes ([@acabunoc](https://github.com/acabunoc))
and [contributors][olts-contributors]. ðŸ”¥ðŸ™Œ

The goal of this list is to make it easier to run an open and inclusive
community by letting you focus on its specifics. The programme above is great
for the specifics. Use this list for the rest or if you're short on time.

## Code of Conduct

A Code of Conduct formally defines what is acceptable, unacceptable, and
encouraged behaviour. Whilst a Code of Conduct may not solve deeply rooted
issues, it is still important to put down in writing the community norms in a
clear and certain manner. Please remember that a Code of Conduct does not negate
the necessity to lead by example.

## Communications & Coordination

Communications channels help others discover, share, and contribute to an
organisation, project, or event. They also serve as a means of coordination for
both timing and vision. These channels come in many forms and it can be a
website, blog, IRC channel, or even a chat bot.

## Collaboration

Whether you're working alone or with collaborators, an organisation or event
produces a lot of documentation during development and planning. It's important
to create an open space (with sensitive material under appropriate access
control) to allow contributors to be productive. Version control software like
`git` or `mercurial`, typically used for code, can also be used for
collaborating on organisational matters.
